			<string>M3LL155X, a five-song EP by FKA twigs accompanied by a 16-minute music video/film, dropped last week, just over a year after the release of twigs&apos; high profile debut, LP1. As a creative package the EP is unimpeachable; a high-concept, intellectually curious piece of work that&apos;s evocative, accessible and transgressive enough to satisfy the competing demands of a newly broadened fanbase and her existing audience of Tumblr-educated aesthetes. M3LL155X (pronounced &apos;Melissa&apos;) builds on her previous work, exploring ideas of psychic and interpersonal dominance and submission, but drills down almost completely into self. The EP takes that ur-feminist mantra &quot;the personal is political&quot; as a starting point, and if we need a feminist pop star, then twigs is it.</string>

			<string>Beach House&apos;s newest album, Depression Cherry, might have the silliest, or at least the most inexplicable, title in their catalog, but in every other sense it’s another impeccably measured step forward. Some minor tweaks result in a sound that retains the band’s grand theatricality, but also lets you smell the grease paint a little more, feel the itch of the Victorian-era fabrics on your skin. Victoria Legrand and Alex Scally have grown so adept at spinning dreams that they can turn all the lights on the set and still dazzle us.</string>

			<string>Dirty Sprite 2 brushes aside the pop overtures of Future&apos;s sophomore album Honest. Building off a powerful three-mixtape comeback run, DS2 is bleak and unforgiving, a redemption story for a man who is certain it’s too late for his soul to be redeemed; instead of a triumphal arc, we burrow deeper and deeper into Future’s dystopian universe. This is music for nihilists, for the reckless, for those who embrace darkness because they don’t see another option.</string>

			<string>Nearly every song on Currents is a statement of leader Kevin Parker&apos;s range and increasing expertise as a producer, arranger, songwriter, and a vocalist. Parker is writing pop songs here, and doing them justice, and Currents is the result of a supernaturally talented obsessive trying to perfect music. The album ends up being Parker&apos;s most convincing case for solitude yet—he knows perfection can be achieved only inside the studio and that progress is the ultimate goal outside of it.</string>

			<string>On Wildheart, Miguel makes good on all of his cross-genre dabbling of the past five years. The album soars with shiny guitar lines and sky-high vocals, while the pompadoured singer explores a sex-positive attitude that focuses on pleasure and partnership instead of one-sided pursuit. If Frank Ocean is young soul&apos;s prismatic, consciousness-expanding Marvin Gaye, Miguel&apos;s the reliable Al Green.</string>

			<string>Vince Staples&apos; first full-length for Def Jam is brilliant. The Long Beach rapper expresses complex ideas in plain, hard sentences, ones that can be handed to you like a pamphlet. His rapping is conversational, but these are the conversations you have when all optimism has been burned away. Summertime &apos;06 was overseen by Dion &quot;No I.D.&quot; Wilson, one-time mentor to Kanye and the force behind all of Def Jam’s best projects for years now. No I.D. seems to grasp the essence of every track he works on; music that has borne his attention almost always emerges with its worldview clarified. On Summertime &apos;06, he turns an album produced largely by himself, DJ Dahi, and Clams Casino into one tense, seething organism, making it difficult to isolate which songs these wildly different musicians worked on.</string>

			<string>Stevie Wonder&apos;s second album this year is in many ways a reprise with variations of the first, Music of My Mind. Both are ambitious, richly-textured, almost entirely the work of Wonder himself, who produced (with assistance, primarily on the Moog work, from Malcolm Cecil and Robert Margouleff), composed the music and all but a few of the lyrics, plays the bulk of the instrumental tracks (aided here and there on Talking Book by eight musicians including, on one cut, Jeff Beck and Buzzy Feiten) and sings densely multi-tracked. Both albums carry Wonder&apos;s music into a new mode, a vigorous, complex style based in Stevie&apos;s experiment&apos;s with the synthesizers and his at once playful and assured use of studio techniques. What flaws there were in Music of My Mind resulted from an overindulgence in techniques, a sort of let&apos;s-see-how-this-sounds fascination with gimmickry which seems to have been brought under control in the new album. So Talking Book is more relaxed, dreamy at times, the laid-back funk of the vocals resting on a deliciously liquid instrumental track like a body on a waterbed. Yet there&apos;s never a lack of energy: Even at its dreamiest, the music has a glowing vibrancy. Talking Book, then, is an extension and refinement of the work begun in Music of My Mind (itself a vast refinement of the uneven efforts in Where I&apos;m Coming From), confirming the achievement and getting more comfortable with it. Making it all seem quite effortless, Wonder has produced another of the very best albums this year.</string>

			<string>Meat Is Murder may have been a holding pattern, but The Queen Is Dead is the Smiths&apos; great leap forward, taking the band to new musical and lyrical heights. Opening with the storming title track, The Queen Is Dead is a harder-rocking record than anything the Smiths had attempted before, but that&apos;s only on a relative scale -- although the backbeat is more pronounced, the group certainly doesn&apos;t rock in a conventional sense. Instead, Johnny Marr has created a dense web of guitars, alternating from the minor-key rush of &quot;Bigmouth Strikes Again&quot; and the faux rockabilly of &quot;Vicar in a Tutu&quot; to the bouncy acoustic pop of &quot;Cemetry Gates&quot; and &quot;The Boy With the Thorn in His Side,&quot; as well as the lovely melancholy of &quot;I Know It&apos;s Over&quot; and &quot;There Is a Light That Never Goes Out.&quot; And the rich musical bed provides Morrissey with the support for his finest set of lyrics. Shattering the myth that he is a self-pitying sap, Morrissey delivers a devastating set of clever, witty satires of British social mores, intellectualism, class, and even himself. He also crafts some of his finest, most affecting songs, particularly in the wistful &quot;The Boy With the Thorn in His Side&quot; and the epic &quot;There Is a Light That Never Goes Out,&quot; two masterpieces that provide the foundation for a remarkable album.</string>

			<string>Often cited as one of the best hip-hop albums of the &apos;90s, Illmatic is the undisputed classic upon which Nas&apos; reputation rests. It helped spearhead the artistic renaissance of New York hip-hop in the post-Chronic era, leading a return to street aesthetics. Yet even if Illmatic marks the beginning of a shift away from Native Tongues-inspired alternative rap, it&apos;s strongly rooted in that sensibility. For one, Nas employs some of the most sophisticated jazz-rap producers around: Q-Tip, Pete Rock, DJ Premier, and Large Professor, who underpin their intricate loops with appropriately tough beats. But more importantly, Nas takes his place as one of hip-hop&apos;s greatest street poets -- his rhymes are highly literate, his raps superbly fluid regardless of the size of his vocabulary. He&apos;s able to evoke the bleak reality of ghetto life without losing hope or forgetting the good times, which become all the more precious when any day could be your last. As a narrator, he doesn&apos;t get too caught up in the darker side of life -- he&apos;s simply describing what he sees in the world around him, and trying to live it up while he can. He&apos;s thoughtful but ambitious, announcing on &quot;N.Y. State of Mind&quot; that &quot;I never sleep, &apos;cause sleep is the cousin of death,&quot; and that he&apos;s &quot;out for dead presidents to represent me&quot; on &quot;The World Is Yours.&quot; Elsewhere, he flexes his storytelling muscles on the classic cuts &quot;Life&apos;s a Bitch&quot; and &quot;One Love,&quot; the latter a detailed report to a close friend in prison about how allegiances within their group have shifted. Hip-hop fans accustomed to 73-minute opuses sometimes complain about Illmatic&apos;s brevity, but even if it leaves you wanting more, it&apos;s also one of the few &apos;90s rap albums with absolutely no wasted space. Illmatic reveals a great lyricist in top form meeting great production, and it remains a perennial favorite among serious hip-hop fans.</string>

			<string>Sonic Youth made a major step forward with 1987&apos;s Sister, their first album where the songs were as strong as the group&apos;s visionary approach and they rocked with the force and authority they&apos;d clearly sought since the beginning. If 1988&apos;s Daydream Nation didn&apos;t make as decisive a leap in terms of theory or style, as far as execution was concerned, it was Sonic Youth&apos;s first unqualified masterpiece, a triumph that made them one of the most respected bands in indie rock. Initially released as a two-LP set, the sheer scope of Daydream Nation was ambitious, but the longer tracks worked to Sonic Youth&apos;s advantage, allowing them the space to lay down solid melodic structures and then use them as a framework for extended jams (thankfully, the band made splendid use of their wanderlust without wearing out their welcome). Sonic Youth were playing at the top of their game on the Daydream Nation sessions; the guitar interplay between Thurston Moore and Lee Ranaldo was stronger and more intuitive than before, and bassist Kim Gordon and drummer Steve Shelley had grown into a powerful rhythm section that cut an impressive groove, giving the band a greater freedom to explore the space around them without getting lost. Sonic Youth were not simply tighter on Daydream Nation, they were making better and more satisfying use of their arsenal of alternate tunings and bent but elemental song structures, and the final product fused their love of creatively applied noise and the sound of the electric guitar with song structures that merged elements of punk, prog, boogie, and psychedelia. The journey from the trippy joy of &quot;Teenage Riot&quot; to the hot-rodded choogle of &quot;Eliminator Jr.&quot; was a bracing, glorious experience, and Daydream Nation confirmed their status as one of America&apos;s best and most original alternative rock bands, and one that had a shot at a future outside the underground -- a pleasant surprise given the alienating air of their earliest work.</string>

			<string>Blessed and cursed with an enormous amount of hype from the British press, the Strokes prove to be one of the few groups deserving of their glowing reviews. Granted, their high-fashion appeal and faultless influences -- Television, the Stooges, and especially Lou Reed and the Velvets -- have &quot;critics&apos; darlings&quot; written all over them. But like the similarly lauded Elastica and Supergrass before them, the Strokes don&apos;t rehash the sounds that inspire them -- they remake them in their own image. On the Modern Age EP, singles like Hard to Explain, and their full-length debut, Is This It, the N.Y.C. group presents a pop-inflected, second-generation take on late-&apos;70s New York punk, complete with raw, world-weary vocals, spiky guitars, and an insistently chugging backbeat. However, their songs also reflected their own early-twenties lust for life; singer/songwriter/guitarist Julian Casablancas and the rest of the band mix swaggering self-assurance with barely concealed insecurity on &quot;The Modern Age&quot; and reveal something akin to earnestness on &quot;Barely Legal&quot; -- a phrase that could apply to the Strokes themselves -- in the song&apos;s soaring choruses. The group revamps &quot;Lust for Life&quot; on &quot;New York City Cops&quot; and combines their raw power and infectious melodies on &quot;Hard to Explain,&quot; arguably the finest song they&apos;ve written in their career. Nearly half of Is This It consists of their previously released material, but that&apos;s not really a disappointment since those songs are so strong. What makes their debut impressive, however, is that the new material more than holds its own with the tried-and-true songs. &quot;Is This It&quot; sets the joys of being young, jaded, and yearning to a wonderfully bouncy bassline; &quot;Alone Together&quot; and &quot;Trying Your Luck&quot; develop the group&apos;s brooding, coming-down side, while &quot;Soma,&quot; &quot;Someday,&quot; and &quot;Take It or Leave It&quot; capture the Strokes at their most sneeringly exuberant. Able to make the timeworn themes of sex, drugs, and rock &amp; roll and the basic guitars-drum-bass lineup seem new and vital again, the Strokes may or may not be completely arty and calculated, but that doesn&apos;t prevent Is This It from being an exciting, compulsively listenable debut. [In light of the World Trade Center disaster, the track &quot;New York City Cops&quot; was pulled from the U.S. release].</string>

			<string>The best Beach Boys album, and one of the best of the 1960s. The group here reached a whole new level in terms of both composition and production, layering tracks upon tracks of vocals and instruments to create a richly symphonic sound. Conventional keyboards and guitars were combined with exotic touches of orchestrated strings, bicycle bells, buzzing organs, harpsichords, flutes, Theremin, Hawaiian-sounding string instruments, Coca-Cola cans, barking dogs, and more. It wouldn&apos;t have been a classic without great songs, and this has some of the group&apos;s most stunning melodies, as well as lyrical themes which evoke both the intensity of newly born love affairs and the disappointment of failed romance (add in some general statements about loss of innocence and modern-day confusion as well). The spiritual quality of the material is enhanced by some of the most gorgeous upper-register male vocals (especially by Brian and Carl Wilson) ever heard on a rock record. &quot;Wouldn&apos;t It Be Nice,&quot; &quot;God Only Knows,&quot; &quot;Caroline No,&quot; and &quot;Sloop John B&quot; (the last of which wasn&apos;t originally intended to go on the album) are the well-known hits, but equally worthy are such cuts as &quot;You Still Believe in Me,&quot; &quot;Don&apos;t Talk,&quot; &quot;I Know There&apos;s an Answer,&quot; and &quot;I Just Wasn&apos;t Made for These Times.&quot; It&apos;s often said that this is more of a Brian Wilson album than a Beach Boys recording (session musicians played most of the parts), but it should be noted that the harmonies are pure Beach Boys (and some of their best). Massively influential upon its release (although it was a relatively low seller compared to their previous LPs), it immediately vaulted the band into the top level of rock innovators among the intelligentsia, especially in Britain, where it was a much bigger hit.</string>

			<string>Def Jam&apos;s contracted edition of Frank Ocean&apos;s Nostalgia, Ultra never materialized. The label nonetheless released two of the mixtape&apos;s songs as singles. One of them, &quot;Novacane,&quot; clashed with everything else on the radio, reached the Top 20 of Billboard&apos;s Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop chart, and crossed into the Hot 100. The singer&apos;s presence spread with appearances on Goblin, 4, Watch the Throne, and The OF Tape, Vol. 2. He then completed this album with Malay, Om&apos;Mas Keith, and Pharrell as his co-producers. Journalists present at June pre-release listening events speculated that some of the lyrics revealed Ocean&apos;s bisexuality. Ocean subsequently published a screen shot of a document, dated December 27, 2011, that included details of a crushing romantic relationship with a male. Ocean also revealed that he wrote for the sake of his sanity and credited his inner circle: &quot;I&apos;m sure these people kept me alive, kept me safe.&quot; One listen to Channel Orange makes it obvious that he is as free as an artist as he is as a man. The album doesn&apos;t have as many slyly powerful hooks as Nostalgia, Ultra, but Ocean&apos;s descriptive and subtle storytelling is taken to a higher level. He&apos;s up there with Bilal. As easy as it is to listen to Ocean&apos;s voice in long stretches -- he&apos;s casually expressive -- the number of deep ruminations over slow tempos requires some patience. Even the lone song that could be termed a banger is a ten-minute suite that takes 90 seconds to get on the floor; the song with the widest and most creative scope as well, &quot;Pyramid&quot; shifts from &quot;my black Queen Cleopatra&quot; and ancient Egypt (over swift synth funk) to &quot;Your love ain&apos;t free no more&quot; and a strip club (over booming, low-profile slickness). The lighter moments, such as the loose and bright &quot;Sweet Life&quot; and the relatively exuberant &quot;Monks,&quot; both of which would be standouts on any N.E.R.D. album, offer more than bright coating, dealing in surrealism and sharp observations that are equally penetrating. On the other end, the most personal song is &quot;Bad Religion,&quot; a phenomenal brokenhearted ballad consisting of organ, piano, strings, and handclaps: &quot;This unrequited love/To me it&apos;s nothing but a one-man cult/And cyanide in my Styrofoam cup.&quot; Everything that falls between, counting the rumbling drug dependency tale &quot;Crack Rock,&quot; the snapping/swooning &quot;Pilot Jones,&quot; and the longing falsetto shuffle &quot;Thinkin Bout You,&quot; is vivid and worthy of complete immersion.</string>

			<string>If Unknown Pleasures was Joy Division at their most obsessively, carefully focused, ten songs yet of a piece, Closer was the sprawl, the chaotic explosion that went every direction at once. Who knows what the next path would have been had Ian Curtis not chosen his end? But steer away from the rereading of his every lyric after that date; treat Closer as what everyone else thought it was at first -- simply the next album -- and Joy Division&apos;s power just seems to have grown. Martin Hannett was still producing, but seems to have taken as many chances as the band itself throughout -- differing mixes, differing atmospheres, new twists and turns define the entirety of Closer, songs suddenly returned in chopped-up, crumpled form, ending on hiss and random notes. Opener &quot;Atrocity Exhibition&quot; was arguably the most fractured thing the band had yet recorded, Bernard Sumner&apos;s teeth-grinding guitar and Stephen Morris&apos; Can-on-speed drumming making for one heck of a strange start. Keyboards also took the fore more so than ever -- the drowned pianos underpinning Curtis&apos; shadowy moan on &quot;The Eternal,&quot; the squirrelly lead synth on the energetic but scared-out-of-its-wits &quot;Isolation,&quot; and above all else &quot;Decades,&quot; the album ender of album enders. A long slow crawl down and out, Curtis&apos; portrait of lost youth inevitably applied to himself soon after, its sepulchral string-synths are practically a requiem. Songs like &quot;Heart and Soul&quot; and especially the jaw-dropping, wrenching &quot;Twenty Four Hours,&quot; as perfect a demonstration of the tension/release or soft/loud approach as will ever be heard, simply intensify the experience. Joy Division were at the height of their powers on Closer, equaling and arguably bettering the astonishing Unknown Pleasures, that&apos;s how accomplished the four members were. Rock, however defined, rarely seems and sounds so important, so vital, and so impossible to resist or ignore as here.</string>

			<string>Although Autobahn was a left-field masterpiece, Trans-Europe Express is often cited as perhaps the archetypal (and most accessible) Kraftwerk album. Melodic themes are repeated often and occasionally interwoven over deliberate, chugging beats, sometimes with manipulated vocals; the effect is mechanical yet hypnotic. Thematically, the record feels like parts of two different concept albums: one a meditation on the disparities between reality and image (&quot;Hall of Mirrors&quot; and &quot;Showroom Dummies&quot; share recurring images of glass, reflection, illusion, and confused identities, as well as whimsical melodies), and the other the glorification of Europe. There is an impressive composition paying homage to &quot;Franz Schubert,&quot; but the real meat of this approach is contained in the opening love letter, &quot;Europe Endless,&quot; and the epic title track, which shares themes and lyrics with the following track, &quot;Metal on Metal.&quot; The song &quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot; is similar in concept to &quot;Autobahn,&quot; as it mimics the swaying motion and insistent drive of a cross-continent train trip. What ultimately holds the album together, though, is the music, which is more consistently memorable even than that on Autobahn. Overall, Trans-Europe Express offers the best blend of minimalism, mechanized rhythms, and crafted, catchy melodies in the group&apos;s catalog; henceforth, their music would take on more danceable qualities only hinted at here (although the title cut provided the basis for Afrika Bambaataa&apos;s enormously important dancefloor smash &quot;Planet Rock&quot;).</string>
